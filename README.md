# a107

A multi-purpose API for Python.
The goal is to stop modifying ```a99``` and take on this.

## Directives

- This API does **not** complement ```a99```. It **overlaps** it, but does not have everything that the formes has.
- This API **will never have anything to do with GUI's, Matplotlib, AstroPy or anything heavy**.
  Or perhaps subpackages not automatically imported.
